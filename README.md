# StealthPipe Relay

This repository contains the StealthPipe relay and is licensed under the MIT License.

### Hosting the Relay

Instructions for self-hosting the relay can be found in `HOSTING.md`.

### Performance

While faster than a Python or NodeJS server, it's still not very optimized due to the amount of locks used. I literally wrote the relay in 3 days, don't judge the spaghetti code please.

### Bugs and Issues

You will probably find a lot of them. Report them in the issues tab.




### Frequently Asked Questions

**High latency or ping**  
Latency depends on your location and the server's load. To improve performance, consider hosting your own relay or using a third-party relay. Choosing a server closer to your location may help reduce ping.
